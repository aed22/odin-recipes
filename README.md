# odin-recipes
A project consisting of collections of my recipes

This is my first HTML project in the Odin Project. It will only consist of HTML elements. This will serve as my starting point.

Skills Demonstrated
- Code the HTML basic structure.
- Apply headings and other text formatting elements like small to show image references.
- Add images for the recipes.
- Utilize lists elements like ul and ol to show the ingredients and steps of each recipe.
- Differentiate the headings and apply their hierarchy appropriately and accordingly.

Still a long way to go but you can do it, Dea! Congratulations.
